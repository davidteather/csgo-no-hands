# CSGO-No-Hands

Hey there, here's code for my hacky solution to playing CSGO without touching my keyboard or mouse.

## Demo

I made a youtube video covering this project as well as some example gameplay of it which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rL8Y2WW6iw)

## Installation

Download this repository. Install chromedriver into your path and install requirements listed in the requirements.txt

## Running

You need to run gaze_backend_wrapper/main.py and calibrate the website that opens up automatically, then you need to run the main.py. I've found that it's quite intense on your GPU and I had to lower my CSGO graphics to the lowest setting to use less cuda cores on my GPU
